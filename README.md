This program consists of 6 courses to develop working skills in the main areas of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and specialized topics such as Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning :octocat:
This project attempts to investigate data consisting of records on healthy life expectancy and number of years lived with disability by countries and years.

Supervised Learning: Regression :octocat:
I used linear regression algorithms to construct a model that accurately predicts how covid-19 affected the global economy of different countries by finding relationship between GDP and human development index and total number of death.

Supervised Learning: Classification :octocat:
ClinVar is a public resource containing annotations about human genetic variants. In this project, I employed classifier models to predicts whether a ClinVar variant had conflicting classifications.

Unsupervised Learning :octocat:
The dataset for this project contains New York Stock Exchange historical metrics. I focused on clustering and apply unsupervised learning techniques to find the best candidate algorithm that accurately predicts whether a company has net profit or net loss.

Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning :octocat:
In this project I used images of Egyptian hieroglyphs found in the Pyramid of Unas. The goal was to train an image classifier from scratch and utilize transfer learning to build a model that recognizes different hieroglyphs and predict their Gardiner labels.

Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis :octocat:
Here I used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict Google daily stock market prices. We are interested in forecasting the 'Close' series.
